<p>Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Considerations for licensors:</strong> Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees#Considerations_for_licensors">More considerations for licensors</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Considerations for the public:</strong> By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees#Considerations_for_licensees">More considerations for the public</a>.</p></li>

<p>a. <em><strong>License grant.</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:</p>
<p>A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and</p>
<p>B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Exceptions and Limitations.</strong> For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Term.</strong> The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.</strong> The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Downstream recipients.</strong></p>
<p>A. <strong>Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material.</strong> Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.</p>

<p>C. <strong>No downstream restrictions.</strong> You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>No endorsement.</strong> Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>b. <em><strong>Other rights.</strong></em></p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.</p></li>
<li><p>To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme.

This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable.

Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.</strong></p>
